The Control Surface Integrator (CSI) is a Reaper plugin that aims to let you integrate your hardware control surfaces into Reaper with a much higher level of control than is possible out of the box. If you're prepared to put in the effort to customize your configuration, you will be able to integrate one or more MIDI, MCU, or OSC, control surfaces into a single virtual surface.

This wiki serves as the official documentation project for the [CSI project for Reaper](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=183143)

This started out as a wiki project by Malcolm Groves, but several people are now helping to fill out the docs, including [Geoff, the developer of CSI](https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=12770) and also [Funkybot](https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=5889). If you'd like to contribute to the docs, let us know on the Reaper forums. 
 
If you find something out of date, either comment to let us know, or even better, edit the page and fix it. Comments, corrections, additions are very welcome.
