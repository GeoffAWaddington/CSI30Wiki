The Control Surface Integrator (CSI) is a Reaper plugin that aims to let you integrate your hardware control surfaces into Reaper with a much higher level of control than is possible out of the box. If you're prepared to put in the effort to customize your configuration, you will be able to integrate one or more MIDI, MCU, or OSC, control surfaces into a single virtual surface.

This wiki serves as the official documentation for the [CSI project for Reaper](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=183143).

This started out as a wiki project by Malcolm Groves, but [Funkybot](https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=5889) is now the major contributor, with a little help from [Geoff, the developer of CSI](https://forum.cockos.com/member.php?u=12770). 
 
If you find something out of date, either comment to let us know. Comments, corrections, additions are very welcome. 

CSI supports MIDI, MCU and OSC.

PC (64 bit) and Mac systems(Catalina or later, including Apple Silicon) are supported.
