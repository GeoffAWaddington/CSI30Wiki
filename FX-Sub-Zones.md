CSI version 1.1 introduced FX Sub Zones. These are useful when you are trying to map an FX that has more parameters than your surface has controls for, or maybe the plugin has multiple FX types or modes and you'd like to put them into different zones you can switch between. This could even be useful for mapping instruments if you wanted to have filter controls on one zone, oscillator controls in another, envelopes and LFO's in another, etc. The sky is the limit with FX sub zones.

For FX Sub Zones to work you basically need a few key elements:

1. Your initial fx.zon file. This should include the parameter mapping you want to see when the plugin is mapped just like any other fx.zon. It should also have a name that matches the plugin, just like any typical fx.zon file. Example: [plugin].zon

2. One or more separate files for each sub zone. Remember: in CSI version 1.1, each zone must be in a separate .zon file (it's one per). It is recommended you number these Sub Zone FX files using the same plugin name, but appending a number to the end of the file in ascending order for each Sub Zone. Example: [plugin]-1.zon and [plugin]-2.zon

3. Instructions in the initial fx.zon file about which SubZones are to be included. See the "SubZones" and "SubZonesEnd" section in the example below.

4. GoSubZone actions in all of the .zon files so CSI knows how to move from zone to zone.

## Example
In this example, I've mapped Limiter 6 GE from Tokyo Dawn Labs across 3 different zones. The primary [plugin].zon has the Compressor controls, the first Sub Zone has the Peak Limiter controls, and the second Sub Zone has the High Frequency Limiter, Clip and Output controls.

I have dedicated banking buttons on my surface (BankA, BankB, and BankC) that I will use to switch between each zone. You can see that each zone includes the GoSubZone  action to jump to the other Banks. You could of course assign different buttons to switch between zones.
